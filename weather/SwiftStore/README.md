### SwiftStore ###
Key/Value store for Swift backed by LevelDB. 

### Usage ###

#### Create instances of store ####

```swift
import SwiftStore

// Create a store.
let store = SwiftStore(storeName: "db")

// Write value
store["username"] = "jondoe"
store["auth-token"] = "cdfsd1231sdf12321"

// Get value
let username = store["username"]!
if !username.isEmpty {
  println(username)
}

let authToken = store["auth-token"]!
if !authToken.isEmpty {
  println(authToken)
}
```

#### As Singleton ####

```swift
class DB : SwiftStore {
    /* Shared Instance */
    static let store = DB()
    
    init() {
        super.init(storeName: "db")
    }
    
    override func close() {
        super.close()
    }
}

DB.store["username"] = "jondoe"
DB.store["auth-token"] = "1231sdfjl123"
